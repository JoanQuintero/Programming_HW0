## Programming Problem 4: Fibonacci Sequence
  
**Explanation:**  
  
The Fibonacci sequence is the series of numbers 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ....  
Formally, it can be expressed as:  
  
>>fib0 = 0  
fib1 = 1  
fibn = fibn−1 + fibn−2  
  
**The Challenge:**  
Write a multithreaded program that generates the Fibonacci sequence.  
  
*This program should work as follows:*  
  
On the command line, the user will enter the number of Fibonacci numbers  
that the program is to generate. The program will then create a separate  
thread that will generate the Fibonacci numbers, placing the sequence in  
data that can be shared by the threads (an array is probably the most  
convenient data structure). When the thread finishes execution, the parent  
thread will output the sequence generated by the child thread. Because the  
parent thread cannot begin outputting the Fibonacci sequence until the child  
thread finishes, the parent thread will have to wait for the child thread to  
finish. Use the techniques described in Section 4.4 to meet this requirement.
